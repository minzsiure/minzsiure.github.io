<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
I am a rising senior at MIT, with a strong passion for theoretical and computational neuroscience, particularly in the realms of **learning and memory**. I am double majoring in **Computer Science (6-4)** and **Mathematics (18)**. My research in the Poggio Lab as a [UROP](https://cbmm.mit.edu/about/people/xie) at MIT CBMM involves developing theoretical understanding of learning and memory with ensembles of neurons (intermediate level of computation in the brain). In the Madry Lab at MIT CSAIL as a [SuperUROP](https://superurop.mit.edu/scholars/eva-yi-xie/), I was driven to comprehend the 'thought' processes underlying AI systems. There, I contributed to the understanding and interpretation of Machine Learning models' decision making process on a neuron level. I am now spending my summer at IBM Research on Graph Neural Networks due to their intriguing connections with brain networks. I am always excited to connect and engage in discussions related to my interests and beyond. Feel free to reach me at [xieyi@mit.edu](mailto:xieyi@mit.edu). 

<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
Include but not limited to:
- **Theoretical/Computational Neuroscience:** learning, memory, cognition, population coding, attractor model.
- **Machine Learning:** biologically plausible learning system, graph-based deep learning, AI Alignment and safe deployment for computer vision & NLP. Exploring AI regulation + policy making.
- **NeuroAI:** A combo of both displines, where the brain inspires better learning algorithm, and AI aids understanding of the brain.

I believe good research needs both the depth and breath of knowledge and understanding. This enables meaningful associations, and thus leads to breakthroughs. So, I am always open to new things :) Before **CompNeuro** and **ML**, I did research in **Bionics**, **Nuclear Science**, and **Genomics**.
