## About Me

I am a second-year PhD student in Neuroscience at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, supported by a Centennial Fellowship. My research focuses on computational and theoretical neuroscience questions that yield insights directly testable by neural experiments, particularly on cognitive abilities such as decision-making and planning. I work with <a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/people/carlos-brody" targert=_blank>Carlos Brody</a>, <a href="https://psychology.princeton.edu/people/nathaniel-daw" targert=_blank>Nathaniel Daw</a>, and <a href="https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/" targert=_blank>Ben Eysenbach</a>. I am a visiting scientist in <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/person/stefan-mihalas/" target=_blank> Stefan Mihalas</a>'s Theory & Modeling group within the Allen Institute.

 I graduated from MIT in May 2024 as a double major S.B. in Computer Science (AI + Decision Making) and Mathematics, with a concentration in Economics. During my undergrad, I worked on grid and place cell modeling with <a href="https://fietelab.mit.edu/people/" target=_blank>Ila Fiete</a>, who I continue to collaborate with. Before then, I worked with <a href="https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/tomaso-poggio/" target=_blank>Tomaso Poggio</a> and <a href="https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu/earl-miller/" target=_blank>Earl Miller</a> on studying interhemispheric transfer of working memory. Aside, I have explored ML research in Madry Lab at MIT CSAIL, and did R&D work at Meta, Microsoft AI, and IBM Research as an intern. <br>

üß†üí≠ We‚Äôre organizing a NeurIPS 2025 workshop, <a href="https://data-brain-mind.github.io/" target=_blank>Data on the Brain & Mind</a>, and would love to see more community involvement!

### Name & Pronunciation
I publish under my official name <b>Yi Xie</b>, but I commonly go by <b>Eva</b>. I often display both names together as <b>Eva Yi Xie</b> (pronounced: <em>Yi-va Yi Shieh</em>), both of which were given to me at birth.

## Research

<!-- My research seeks to understand <b>how multiple brain regions encode information and communicate with one another to coordinate the processes that allow us to interact with‚Äîand learn about‚Äîthe world and ourselves</b>. These processes include navigating our surroundings and gathering information to make everyday decisions, which together shape <b>nearly all</b> of our daily activities and ultimately shape <em>who we are</em>. Yet, we still understand <em>remarkably little</em> about the neural mechanisms underlying these <em>fundamental</em> cognitive processes and behaviors. -->

Broadly, I view cognition as a computational process grounded in the basis of neurons and synapses, and I believe we can gain insights into these processes through models of neural networks. With the very recent development of large-scale neurophysiological recordings and connectome datasets, we now have unprecedented opportunities to investigate: <b><em>How do multiple brain regions interact to support cognition?</em></b>  To that end, my research has spanned three main directions:

1. <b>Normative</b>: Developing biologically plausible models of interacting brain regions that perform brain-like computations, to uncover principles of neural coding and information flow that can be directly verified with neurophysiology experiments <a href="https://minzsiure.github.io/multiregion-brain-model/" target="_blank">[<b>Yi Xie</b>, Jaedong Hwang, Carlos Brody, David Tank, Ila Fiete; ICML 2025]</a>;

2. <b>Mechanistic</b>: Analyzing networks with biologically plausible properties, such as theoretically underexplored heavy-tailed synaptic weight distributions <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09816" target="_blank">[<b>Yi Xie</b>, Stefan Mihalas, ≈Åukasz Ku≈õmierz; NeurIPS 2025]</a>, <em>or</em> skip connections <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=EJmgk8vXMQ" target="_blank">[<b>Yi Xie<sup>*</sup></b>, Yichen Li<sup>*</sup>, Akshay Ranganmani; NeurIPS AMHN 2023]</a>, to reveal the dynamics and constraints imposed by connectivity structure alone;

3. <b>Descriptive</b>: Creating computational tools to decode multi-region coordinated neural signals and capture the moment-to-moment computations animals perform when making decisions (<em>e.g., When precisely do animals make up their mind?</em>) <a href="#" style="pointer-events:none; cursor:default; text-decoration:none;">[<b>Ongoing</b>]</a>.

Together, these efforts aim to advance our understanding of neural computation and may also offer useful insights for developing AI systems that reflect key properties of the brain‚Äîsuch as robustness and efficiency.

<!-- I am interested in how population of neurons encodes information and participates in learning, memory, and other cognitive functions. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any low dimensional representations being shared across various tasks and/or organisms. I study this line of work through close collaboration with experimentalists, and keep an eye out for their potential applications in building intelligent systems or understanding neurological disorders. -->

<!-- ## Before Graduate School

During my undergrad study, I conducted my research as an MIT CBMM [UROP](https://cbmm.mit.edu/about/people/xie) with Prof. Tomaso Poggio (collab w/ Prof. Earl Miller), and Prof. Ila Fiete (collab w/ Princeton BRAIN CoGS, including Prof. David Tank & Prof. Carlos Brody). I am continuing the collaborative ties now as a research affiliate. Previously, I conducted ML research in Madry Lab at MIT CSAIL as a [SuperUROP](https://superurop.mit.edu/scholars/eva-yi-xie/), and did R&D work at Meta, Microsoft AI, and IBM Research as an intern.

Personally, I have been fortunate to benefit from learning opportunities and mentorships. Equity in education in my community and society at large is important to me. During my undergrad study, aside from leadership activities, I served on advisory boards/cabinet to provide insights to MIT President Sally Kornbluth, Dean Anantha Chandrakasan (School of Engineering), and MIT EECS leaderships in driving this goal.

I am happy to connect and engage in discussions related to my interests and beyond. Feel free to reach me at evayixie [at] princeton [dot] edu for any inquiry.  -->

<!-- <h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
Include but not limited to:
- <strong>Theoretical/Computational Neuroscience:<strong> learning, memory, cognition, population coding, attractor model.
- <strong>Machine Learning:<strong> biologically plausible learning system, AI Alignment and safe deployment. Exploring AI regulation + policy making.
- <strong>NeuroAI:<strong> A combo of both displines, where the brain inspires better learning algorithm, and AI aids our understanding of the brain.

I believe good research needs both the depth and breath of knowledge and understanding. This enables meaningful associations, and thus leads to breakthroughs. So, I am always open to new things :) Before <strong>CompNeuro<strong> and <strong>NeuroAI<strong>, I did research in <strong>Bionics<strong>, <strong>Nuclear Science<strong>, and <strong>Genomics<strong>. -->
