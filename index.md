<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
I recently graduated from MIT with double majors in **Computer Science (AI + Decision Making)** and **Mathematics**, with a concentration in Economics. In pursuit of my passion for [cognitive computational neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0210-5#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20cognitive%20computational,perform%20real%2Dworld%20cognitive%20tasks){:target="_blank"}, I just started my PhD study in Neuroscience at Princeton Neuroscience Institute in September 2024, on a Centennial Fellowship. I spent the past summer at the Theory & Modeling group within the Allen Institute to pursue research in mathematical neuroscience under the supervision of Prof. Stefan Mihalas, where I currently hold a visiting scientist position.

<!-- I am interested in how population of neurons encodes information and participates in learning, memory, and other cognitive functions. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any low dimensional representations being shared across various tasks and/or organisms. I study this line of work through close collaboration with experimentalists, and keep an eye out for their potential applications in building intelligent systems or understanding neurological disorders. -->

During my undergrad study, I conducted my research as an MIT CBMM [UROP](https://cbmm.mit.edu/about/people/xie) with Prof. Tomaso Poggio (collab w/ Prof. Earl Miller), and Prof. Ila Fiete (collab w/ Princeton BRAIN CoGS, including Prof. David Tank & Prof. Carlos Brody). I am continuing the collaborative ties now as a research affiliate. Previously, I conducted ML research in Madry Lab at MIT CSAIL as a [SuperUROP](https://superurop.mit.edu/scholars/eva-yi-xie/), and did R&D work at Meta, Microsoft AI, and IBM Research as an intern.

Personally, I have been fortunate to benefit from learning opportunities and mentorships. Equity in education in my community and society at large is important to me. During my undergrad study, aside from leadership activities, I served on advisory boards/cabinet to provide insights to MIT President Sally Kornbluth, Dean Anantha Chandrakasan (School of Engineering), and MIT EECS leaderships in driving this goal.

I am happy to connect and engage in discussions related to my interests and beyond. Feel free to reach me at [evayixie@princeton.edu](mailto:evayixie@princeton.edu) for any inquiry. 

<!-- <h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
Include but not limited to:
- **Theoretical/Computational Neuroscience:** learning, memory, cognition, population coding, attractor model.
- **Machine Learning:** biologically plausible learning system, AI Alignment and safe deployment. Exploring AI regulation + policy making.
- **NeuroAI:** A combo of both displines, where the brain inspires better learning algorithm, and AI aids our understanding of the brain.

I believe good research needs both the depth and breath of knowledge and understanding. This enables meaningful associations, and thus leads to breakthroughs. So, I am always open to new things :) Before **CompNeuro** and **NeuroAI**, I did research in **Bionics**, **Nuclear Science**, and **Genomics**. -->
