<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
I am a senior at MIT studying **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**, with a strong passion for [cognitive computational neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0210-5#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20cognitive%20computational,perform%20real%2Dworld%20cognitive%20tasks). I will start my PhD study in Neuroscience at Princeton Neuroscience Institute this fall. 

I am interested in how population of neurons encodes information and participates in learning, memory, and other cognitive functions. Additionally, I am interested in exploring any low dimensional representations being shared across various tasks and/or organisms. I study this line of work through close collaboration with experimentalists, and keep an eye out for their potential applications in building intelligent systems or understanding neurological disorders.

I am currently conducting my research as a MIT CBMM [UROP](https://cbmm.mit.edu/about/people/xie) with Prof. Tomaso Poggio (collab w/ Prof. Earl Miller), and Prof. Ila Fiete (collab w/ Princeton CoGS's experimentalists). Previously, I conducted ML research in Madry Lab at MIT CSAIL as a [SuperUROP](https://superurop.mit.edu/scholars/eva-yi-xie/), and at Microsoft AI and IBM Research as an intern.

Personally, I have been fortunate to benefit from learning opportunities and mentorships. Equity in education in my community and society at large is important to me. As a student leader, I have done various impactful works and I am now on advisory boards/cabinet to provide insights to MIT President Sally Kornbluth, Dean Anantha Chandrakasan (School of Engineering), and MIT EECS leaderships in driving this goal.

I am always excited to connect and engage in discussions related to my interests and beyond. Feel free to reach me at [xieyi@mit.edu](mailto:xieyi@mit.edu) for any inquiry. 

<!-- <h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
Include but not limited to:
- **Theoretical/Computational Neuroscience:** learning, memory, cognition, population coding, attractor model.
- **Machine Learning:** biologically plausible learning system, AI Alignment and safe deployment. Exploring AI regulation + policy making.
- **NeuroAI:** A combo of both displines, where the brain inspires better learning algorithm, and AI aids our understanding of the brain.

I believe good research needs both the depth and breath of knowledge and understanding. This enables meaningful associations, and thus leads to breakthroughs. So, I am always open to new things :) Before **CompNeuro** and **NeuroAI**, I did research in **Bionics**, **Nuclear Science**, and **Genomics**. -->
